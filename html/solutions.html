                <li>
                    Great strides have been made to reduce poverty in the Philippines. There is a growing middle class, a long-term decrease from 1985 in the poverty rate and more people have started to achieve economic security. All of this, in addition to the expansion of secondary education and a reduction in income inequality due to government social assistance, has created good news for the fight against poverty.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Despite the progress, more work is necessary. The COVID-19 pandemic has turned back progress in several areas across the globe, especially in the Philippines. Between 2018 and 2021, about 2.3 million people were pushed into poverty, according to the Filipino government. This increase is due to the economic downturn that COVID-19 has caused. In 2021, the number of people living in poverty rose to almost 20 million, which is a little more than 18% of the population. That is up from 16.7% in 2018. 
                </li>
                <li>
                    The population of the middle class had ballooned to 12 million people, and the amount of the population that had become economically secure had reached 44 million people. The report highlighted more accomplishments as well, including “the expansion of secondary education, mobility towards better-paying jobs, access to basic services and government social assistance have started to reduce inequality since the mid-2000s.”

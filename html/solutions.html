                <li> <strong>1. Education:</strong>  The expansion of secondary education is central to improving the skills and employability of the youth, <br>
                    particularly in rural areas where poverty is most severe. By increasing access to quality education, the government aims to equip the next <br>
                     generation with the tools they need to secure better jobs and break the cycle of poverty.</li>
                <br>
                <li> <strong>2. Job Creation</strong> Diversifying the economy is another critical aspect of the anti-poverty strategy. The government is actively <br>
                     working to create jobs outside of traditional sectors like agriculture, particularly in urban areas. This includes promoting industries such as <br>
                      manufacturing, services, and technology, which have the potential to provide higher wages and more stable employment.</li>
                <br>
                <li> <strong>3. Infrastructure Development:</strong>  To support economic growth in rural areas, the government is investing in infrastructure projects, <br>
                     including farm-to-market roads and sanitation systems. These projects not only improve access to markets and services but also enhance the overall <br>
                      quality of life for rural residents. Better infrastructure facilitates the movement of goods and people, making it easier for rural communities <br>
                       to engage in economic activities and benefit from national growth.</li>
                <br>
                <li> <strong>4. Human Capital Investment:</strong>  Recognizing that economic growth alone is not enough to reduce poverty, the government is <br>
                     prioritizing investments in health, education, and social protection. By improving access to healthcare and education, the government seeks to <br>
                      ensure that all Filipinos, regardless of their socio-economic background, have the opportunity to contribute to and benefit from economic development. <br>
                       Social protection programs are also in place to provide a safety net for the most vulnerable populations.</li>
                <br>
                <li> <strong>5. Economic Transformation: </strong>  The government is also focused on transforming the countryâ€™s production sectors to generate quality jobs. <br>
                     This involves modernizing industries and promoting sectors with high growth potential, such as technology and renewable energy. By fostering innovation <br>
                      and supporting emerging industries, the government aims to create a more dynamic economy that can provide sustainable employment opportunities for a <br> broader segment of the population.</li>

                <li> Despite the challenges posed by the COVID-19 pandemic, these initiatives are part of a broader goal to significantly reduce poverty by 2028. <br>
                         The government's approach reflects a recognition that addressing poverty requires not only economic growth but also targeted interventions <br>
                          that address the root causes of poverty and inequality.</li>
                <br>
                <li> The Philippines is addressing poverty through a combination of education, job creation, infrastructure development, human capital investment, <br>
                        and economic transformation. Expanding secondary education aims to improve youth employability, while efforts to create jobs outside agriculture <br>
                        are diversifying the economy. Infrastructure projects like farm-to-market roads and sanitation systems boost rural economies and living conditions. <br>
                        Investments in health, education, and social protection enhance human capital. Finally, transforming production sectors focuses on generating sustainable, <br>
                        quality jobs. These initiatives aim to significantly reduce poverty by 2028.</li>

                <p>MANILA – The administration of President Ferdinand R. Marcos Jr. is doubling efforts to attain its single-digit poverty rate target by 2028. In his first State of the Nation Address in 2022, President Marcos vowed to bring down poverty to as low as 9 percent by the end of his term.</p>
                <p>Latest data from the Philippine Statistics Authority (PSA) showed that the country's poverty rate already declined to 22.4 percent in the first half of 2023 from 23.7 percent in the same period in 2021.</p>

                <p>He said the government's strategy will focus on fully reopening the economy, investing in human capital and social protection, and transforming production sectors to generate more and quality jobs and competitive products.</p>

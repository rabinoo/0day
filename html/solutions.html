                    Despite the challenges posed by the COVID-19 pandemic, these initiatives are part of a broader goal to significantly reduce poverty by 2028. 
                    The government's approach reflects a recognition that addressing poverty requires not only economic growth but also targeted interventions 
                    that address the root causes of poverty and inequality.
                </li>
                <li> 
                    The Philippines is addressing poverty through a combination of education, job creation, infrastructure development, human capital investment, 
                    and economic transformation. Expanding secondary education aims to improve youth employability, while efforts to create jobs outside agriculture 
                    are diversifying the economy. Infrastructure projects like farm-to-market roads and sanitation systems boost rural economies and living conditions. 
                    Investments in health, education, and social protection enhance human capital. Finally, transforming production sectors focuses on generating sustainable, 
                    quality jobs. These initiatives aim to significantly reduce poverty by 2028.
